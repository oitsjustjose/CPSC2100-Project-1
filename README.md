# UTC Software Design Project 1

These files are going to look weird in the online-viewer - that's because there's no GitHub Integration for UML.
If you simply download this entire repository as a .zip, you'll be able to open the files in UMLET where they'll
display properly. Feel free to make changes to uml files that you think have issues, we want to get the best grade!
